# Pre-commit Hook Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

I've implemented a comprehensive pre-commit hook system that runs the same checks as your CI pipeline locally before each commit. This will save time by catching issues early and preventing failed CI runs.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Pre-commit Hook Scripts
- **`.git/hooks/pre-commit`** - The main pre-commit hook that runs on every commit
- **`scripts/pre-commit`** - Copy of the hook for easy installation
- **`scripts/setup-precommit.sh`** - Setup script to install the pre-commit hook
- **`scripts/setup-dev.sh`** - Development environment setup script

### 2. Documentation
- **`docs/PRE-COMMIT.md`** - Comprehensive documentation for the pre-commit hook
- **`README.md`** - Updated with development section and pre-commit hook instructions

## What the Pre-commit Hook Does

The hook runs the exact same checks as your CI pipeline:

1. **flake8 linting** - Code style and potential errors
2. **black formatting check** - Ensures code is properly formatted
3. **isort import sorting** - Verifies imports are properly sorted
4. **mypy type checking** - Static type analysis
5. **pytest tests** - Runs all tests with coverage reporting
6. **Security checks** - Runs safety and bandit (optional, won't fail commit)

## Key Features

- **Colored output** - Easy to read success/error messages
- **Dependency checking** - Verifies all required tools are available
- **Virtual environment support** - Works with venv and provides setup guidance
- **Non-blocking security checks** - Security issues won't prevent commits but will show warnings
- **Helpful error messages** - Tells you exactly how to fix issues

## Usage Instructions

### For New Developers

```bash
# 1. Set up development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# 2. Install pre-commit hook
./scripts/setup-precommit.sh

# 3. Start developing - hook will run automatically on commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### For Existing Developers

```bash
# Just install the pre-commit hook
./scripts/setup-precommit.sh
```

## Benefits

- **Faster feedback** - Catch issues immediately instead of waiting for CI
- **Reduced CI failures** - Prevent commits that would fail in CI
- **Consistent code quality** - Ensure all commits meet project standards
- **Time savings** - Avoid the cycle of commit → CI failure → fix → commit

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Missing dependencies**: Run `./scripts/setup-dev.sh` to set up a virtual environment
2. **Hook not running**: Check if it's executable with `ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit`
3. **Permission issues**: Run `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

## Next Steps

1. Test the pre-commit hook by making a commit
2. Share the setup instructions with your team
3. Consider adding the scripts directory to version control (currently not tracked)

The pre-commit hook is now ready to use and will help maintain code quality by catching issues before they reach CI!
